<title>About Test My Internet...</title>

<xmp theme="cerulean" style="display:none;">
The prototype *Test My Internet* page keeps an eye on your internet connection.

It displays a list of hosts that it can detect (Google, and maybe your router),
and then continually checks to see if they're working.
Success/failure information is displayed in the text on the right.

Leave the page open while you work on other things (perhaps in another window).

My requests for testers:

- Let it run for a while (hours, or a day)
- Tell me the list of hosts it finds (on the left). There will be one or two in this prototype.
- Did it detect any outages? Do they correspond with any interruptions you saw?
- Let me know what it shows in the text on the right (copy/paste would be fine)
- Tell me the browser (Chrome, IE, Edge, Firefox, etc.) and OS (Windows, Mac, other) that you're using
- Let me know your reaction to what it provides, and features you'd like to have added
- And of course, please tell me of bugs/weirdness that you notice

Thanks again.
