A Single Page (web) Application (SPA) that queries web hosts to see if they're alive. 
It runs as long as the page is open, and saves the state in localStorage.
Ultimately, it will show a history with time-stamped up/down events.

##Tasks to complete

* LogToWindow(only when item changes state )
* Write state changes to localStorage, display when the device is clicked
* Add Add/Remove (+/-) buttons 
* Settings for polling interval, clear out history, etc.
