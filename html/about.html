<title>About Test My Internet...</title>

<xmp theme="cerulean" style="display:none;">
This *Test My Internet* page keeps an eye on your internet connection.

It checks whether it can connect back to the TestMyInter.net server every 30 seconds,
and displays success/failure information in the text on the right.

Leave the page open while you work on other things (perhaps in another window).

My requests for testers:

- Let it run for a while (hours, a day, or more)
- Did it detect any outages? Do they correspond with any interruptions you saw?
- Let me know what it shows in the text on the right (copy/paste would be fine)
- Let me know your reaction to the page - does it make sense?

Thanks again.
