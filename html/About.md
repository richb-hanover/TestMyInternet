## The _Test My Internet_ Story...

People always gripe to me that their Internet is terrible - it goes up and down "all the time".
But when I ask how often, they say, "I'm not sure... yesterday for sure, and maybe last Tuesday..." 
Even if their ISP wanted to be helpful, I know that those vague complaints aren't useful.

To arm my neighbors with actual information about outages, I created this site.

This *Test My Internet* page keeps an eye on your internet connection.
Every 30 seconds, it checks the connection back to the _TestMyInter.net_ server,
and displays success/failure results in the window.

Leave this page open while you work on other things (you might open another window.)
The tests continue to run in the background. 
If you do close this page, the history of the tests (successes and failures) gets saved; 
when you come back here, the history gets reloaded.

I've been using this, but I have some requests for testers:

- Let it run for a while (hours, a day, or more)
- Did it detect any outages? Do they correspond with any interruptions you saw/noticed?
- Let me know what it shows in the text (copy/paste would be fine)
- Did the page make sense? Do you have any questions?

Thanks again.
