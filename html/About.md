## About _Test My Internet_

This *Test My Internet* page keeps an eye on your internet connection.

Every 30 seconds, it tests the connection back to the _TestMyInter.net_ server,
and displays success/failure results.

Leave this page open while you work on other things (you might open another window.)
The tests continue to run in the background. 
If you do close this page, the history of the tests (successes and failures) gets saved; 
when you come back, the page reloads the history.

Requests for testers:

- Let it run for a while (hours, a day, or more)
- Did it detect any outages? Do they correspond with any interruptions you saw/noticed?
- Let me know what it shows in the text (copy/paste would be fine)
- Did the page make sense? Do you have any questions?

Thanks again.
