## About _Test My Internet_

This *Test My Internet* page keeps an eye on your internet connection.

Every 30 seconds, it tests the connection back to the _TestMyInter.net_ server,
and displays success/failure results.

Leave the page open while you work on other things (perhaps in another window).
The tests run in the background. 
If you do close the main page, the history of the tests (successes and failures) gets saved, 
so you can re-open the page and still see that history.

Requests for testers:

- Let it run for a while (hours, a day, or more)
- Did it detect any outages? Do they correspond with any interruptions you saw/noticed?
- Let me know what it shows in the text (copy/paste would be fine)
- Did the page make sense? Do you have any questions?

Thanks again.
